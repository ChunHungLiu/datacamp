datamind helps you to create interactive courses with R for the [DataMind platform](http://www.datamind.org)!

This package is a wrapper around the [slidify package](http://www.slidify.org) of  Ramnath Vaidyanathan. Over time We'll keep adding functionality to datamind which is specific to the creation of interactive R courses for [DataMind](http://www.datamind.org). Don't hesitate to contribute ;-).
