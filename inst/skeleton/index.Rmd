## The title of the first exercise

In the assignement, you can explain statistical concepts or R functionality. Assignments are written in (R) Markdown.

You can emphasize important words by putting them in **bold** or *italics*, or indicate that some parts are `r_code` with backticks, but what's really cool is that you can incorporate LATEX style formula's, e.g. $\frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\beta_i} = E(R_m) - R_f$ You can even add lists, to structure your explanation: 
- item one
- item two

Or you could link to interesting content: [this is a link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), or [another useful link](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown...).

*** =instructions
  - Provide one instruction to your students/employees/... on what specific problem they should solve in this exercise
  - Provide a second instruction here.
  - ect.

*** =hint

Hints help the students to find a correct solution for the exercise. Hints are optional, but their usage is highly recommended.

*** =sample_code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# The sample code is what is shown in the students editor by default
```

*** =solution

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# The solution code solves the assignement. Make sure the solution passes the submission correctness test (we will check this;-)!
```

*** =sct

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# The Submission Correctness Test code
# It takes as input the students workspace, his code and what was printed to the console during the exercise.
# Based on these inputs the SCT returns:
# (i) whether the students code was correct
# (ii) a message to the student to either help him find what was wrong or congragulate him on finding the solution.
```

*** =pre_exercise_code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Pre-exercise code is executed before the exercise starts (what's in a name...)
# It can be used to:
# Pre-load a dataset
# Render graphs that are shown at the start of the exercise
# ...
```
