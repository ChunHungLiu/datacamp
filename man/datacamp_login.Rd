\description{
To be able to upload your course to the DataCamp platform, you need to log in to set-up the connection. The function will prompt for your
DataCamp username and password, and will then log you into the DataCamp server. Optionally, a subdomain can be specified (the default is
www.DataCamp.com). Note, in addition to the log in via R, it is also necessary to log into DataCamp.com via your browser.
